<p><em>Disclaimer: we were not in any way paid or solicited by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://drinkolipop.com" target="_blank">drinkolipop.com</a> to write this review, but if they would like to give us a couple cases, we wouldn't say no.</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A couple months ago, Dan and Ana introduced me (i.e., got me addicted) to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://drinkolipop.com" target="_blank">Olipop</a> soft drinks. Olipop is a "new kind of soda," one of those newfangled "functional drinks," that are supposed to be both tasty and have some health benefits. In Olipop's case, each can says that it supports digestive health. I can't speak to that, but they are damn tasty.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are 10 flavors available now, with Banana Cream being the newest addition. Even though we had tried most or all the flavors, Ana, Dan, and I decided to do a systematic review of each flavor. <em>(Note: we later learned that Orange Cream is a "seasonal" flavor, and a previous seasonal flavor, Blackberry Vanilla, is currently not available.)</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>These tastings were split over several days, because that's a lot of soda to consume at once. Comments have been reconstituted from hastily taken notes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Day One: Banana Cream, Tropical Punch, Classic Grape</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We tried these three flavors together in person when I visited Dan and Ana.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"backgroundColor":"luminous-vivid-amber"} --></p>

</figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Banana Cream comes in a very yellow can emblazoned with, of all things, a Minion. This co-branding seems to be a first for Olipop, and Ana asked how this came to be, aside from the story on the side of the can.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Bouquet</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Me: It smells like banana candy<br />Dan: Like banana candy or banana bread<br />Ana: Like banana bread with a hint of vanilla</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Color</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: It looks milkier with a slight thickness<br />Me: It looks like lemonade<br />Dan: I dunno, yellow?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: It tastes less intense than it smells. It has light carbonation<br />Dan: Smooth mouthfeel, slight tingle<br />Me: What Ana said. It tastes sweet but not as chemical as it smells. It's more like a tonic.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Me: Potable but not my first choice.<br />Dan: It's ok I guess. An amusing novelty.<br />Ana: I think it's nicely refreshing. Also not my first choice.<br />After I admit that I'd never seen of the Minion movies, Dan asks if I'm more likely to watch <em>The Rise of Gru</em> after drinking the Banana Cream. (No, I am not.)</p>

<figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Thankfully it's not dyed Hawaiian Punch red</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dan had previously noted that the name Tropical Punch reminded him of Hawaiian Punch, that faux-tropical and vert faux-red soft drink purveying to suburban kids. (I can remember the color, although I can't remember how it tastes. If I did taste it again, though, I would know.)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Color</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Me: Not dyed red like Hawaiian Punch<br />Ana notes this flavor isn't as cloudy as the Banana Cream.<br />Dan: Looks like pee</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Bouquet</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: Pineapple, much less intense than the banana<br />Dan: Smells like pineapple, although it doesn't smell artificial like the banana<br />Me: Pineapple</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: Pineapple juice without the acidity, more sweetness<br />Me: Slight afternotes of passion fruit?<br />Dan: Not acidic. I can't taste anything except the pineapple</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: It tastes like pineapple and very sweet. It's not as carbonated as the banana.<br />Me: Very sweet<br />Dan: It makes me want to try real Hawaiian Punch again</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"backgroundColor":"vivid-purple"} --></p>
<h2 class="has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://drinkolipop.com/products/classic-grape" target="_blank">Classic Grape</a></h2>

</figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Color</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: I can see bubbles. Prettiest color so far, like a deep red ruby<br />Dan and I agree it is very clear</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Bouquet</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: The smell is not that strong. It smells like candy.<br />Dan: It smells like Welch's Grape Juice<br />Me: Yeah, like the can of concentrate you'd get in the frozen food aisle</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: It feels less sweet than the others.<br />Dan: It has a sweet aftertaste that lingers<br />Ana: Tastes more artificial.<br />Me: I would drink it but probably only if it was the last can in the fridge</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Day One summary</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We all agree that the Tropical Punch is probably our favorite so far.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Day Two: Classic Root Beer &amp; Strawberry Vanilla</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>We performed this and the following tastings virtually over Zoom.</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"backgroundColor":"luminous-vivid-amber","textColor":"black"} --></p>
<h2 class="has-black-color has-luminous-vivid-amber-background-color has-text-color has-background"><a href="https://drinkolipop.com/products/classic-root-beer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Classic Root Beer</a></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana, a naturalized American, starts by noting that she thinks of root beer as "one of those American things only Americans like." Dan says that when they send her to American reprogramming camp, they will have A&amp;W Root Beer there. I assume there will also be Hawaiian Punch and Welch's grape juice.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Clear and slightly carbonated</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Bouquet</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Me: No real smell<br />Ana: Smells like medicine<br />Me: Smells like root beer</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: Makes me think of something I get at the dentist, like mouthwash or toothpaste or something. Vague mint aftertaste<br />Dan: Like root beer but with some olipopness with it. No bite, more like being gently gummed.<br />Me: Definitely tastes weaker than A&amp;W<br />Ana: I would definitely drink this if I was lost on a desert island and the others were gone. It's less bad than I thought it would be.<br />Me: Tastes a little watered down.<br />Dan: It's still one of my favorites<br />Dan (reading the label): "organic root beer flavor extract"</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At this point I launch into my story about living in Pennsylvania as a kid, where the local pizza parlor had both a player piano and birch beer. We google to figure out the difference (the kind of tree roots used, unsurprisingly.) I can't remember the taste difference after this many decades, though.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"backgroundColor":"pale-pink"} --></p>
<h2 class="has-pale-pink-background-color has-background"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://drinkolipop.com/products/strawberry-vanilla" target="_blank">Strawberry Vanilla</a></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Color/Bouquet</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dan: Some solids<br />Me: It does smell a bit like candy strawberry<br />Ana: Yes, less intense<br />Dan: Smells like strawberry ice cream<br />Me: Maybe a little like strawberry medicine?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Me: Not a strong taste<br />Ana: Kind of pleasant, not very obviously strawberry. Mild compared to the root beer</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Impressions</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dan, reading the can: "Himalayan pink salt"<br />(A discussion about the pros, cons, and general questions around Himalayan pink salt ensued.)<br />Ana: I quite like this but closer to flavored sparkling water. Like it has been in the same room as a strawberry. Tastes less sweet than it smells, less sweet than the banana cream. (To Dan: Where's the cat?)<br />Me: Pleasant unlike the powerwash of Cherry Vanilla (full review to follow)<br />Ana: tastes very one-note<br />Me: Less like Olipop pop<br />Dan: I'm still surprised by the Himalayan pink salt</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Day Two summary</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Current stack rankings after 2 days and 5 pops:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: Strawberry Vanilla, Tropical Punch, and Banana Cream are close together, a bit higher than Classic Grape. Classic Root Beer is decisively at the bottom.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dan: Classic Root Beer is top, following by Tropical Punch, Banana Cream, Classic Grape, and Strawberry Vanilla</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Me: Strawberry Vanilla is barely on top, then Tropical Punch, Classic Root Beer, Banana Cream, and Classic Grape</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Day Three: Battle of the Oranges</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Olipop has two orange-themed flavors, Orange Squeeze and Orange Cream. We decided to try these two side-by-side as the best way to compare their orange-iness.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"backgroundColor":"luminous-vivid-orange"} --></p>
<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-background"><a href="https://drinkolipop.com/products/orange-squeeze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orange Squeeze</a></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Color/Bouquet</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Me: Smells like orangeade<br />Dan: More pulp than orangeade. It looks like a Tropicana orange product that has been puréed then added back.<br />Ana: Smells more like orange juice than soda.<br />Me: It smells a little like Tang.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Me: Sedate taste<br />Ana: Like a more pleasant Tang<br />Dan: I like it<br />Ana: Quite good, my favorite so far<br />Me: Not too sweet<br />Ana: It actually has more sugar than some of the others<br />Dan: Light Olipop light carbonations<br />Ana: Like more diluted Orange Fanta but in a good way</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: It's just nice</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"backgroundColor":"luminous-vivid-orange"} --></p>
<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-background"><a href="https://drinkolipop.com/products/orange-cream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orange Cream</a></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Color/Bouquet</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Me: Does it live up to the hype?<br />Ana: Slightly cloudier than Orange Squeeze<br />Me: Smells more vanilla than Orange Squeeze</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dan: They really have nailed that creamsicle flavor<br />Me: I taste the orange first and then the "cream"<br />(Notes both Orange Squeeze and Orange Cream have 12% juice)<br />Me: it's not like there's milkfat or some solid to give it that cream feel</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Impressions</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: When I'm thirsty I'd just go for the Orange Squeeze. Orange Cream isn't really chuggable. Orange Cream is sweeter.<br />Dan: I feel like these would make good ice cream floats.<br />Me: Orange Cream would make a better after-dinner faux-liqueur</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Day Three summary</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>New stack ranks:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: Orange Squeeze and Orange Cream are at the top, depends on which I need</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dan: Orange Cream, Classic Root Beer, Orange Squeeze</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Me: Orange Cream, Orange Squeeze, then Strawberry Vanilla</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Day Four: Vintage Cola, Cherry Vanilla, Ginger Lemon</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"backgroundColor":"luminous-vivid-amber"} --></p>
<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-amber-background-color has-background"><a href="https://drinkolipop.com/products/vintage-cola" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vintage Cola</a></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Note: Vintage Cola seems to be the only flavor with caffeine in it, which comes from some green tea.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Color/Bouquet</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dan: It smells like coke on an airplane<br />Ana: Yeah, it absolutely does smell like that, why is that?<br />We agree it has the traditional coke/cola/pop color, although it's not as fizzy<br />I try to describe how I think maybe it smells a little like RC Cola, but only because I can't remember how that smells (as opposed to Coke or Pepsi)<br />Ana: It smells of cola in a way Coke doesn't<br />Mostly I think it smells flat</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I also think it tastes flat<br />Dan: It feels even flatter than their (Olipop's) root beer<br />Ana: I enjoy it because it is more lightweight<br />We talk a lot about how we can't help but compare it to the mainstream colas, good or bad.<br />Dan: I still like it<br />Me: I just think it tastes like flat off-brand cola</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"backgroundColor":"pale-pink"} --></p>
<h2 class="has-pale-pink-background-color has-background"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://drinkolipop.com/products/cherry-vanilla" target="_blank">Cherry Vanilla</a></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dan always calls this flavor Cherry Pie, because he likened drinking one to the experience of having a McDonalds cherry pie shoved into one's mouth.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana, looking at the color: Garnet<br />Dan: Black cherry<br />Both: very pretty color<br />Ana: I barely notice a scent, it's almost herbal<br />Me: Light medicinal overtone<br />Dan: We're starting to get closer to its true horrible nature<br />Dan: It smells like maraschino cherry<br />Me: No, not nearly as sweet as maraschino, and this also tastes like it was near an actual cherry<br />Dan (reads label): "White cherry flavor"</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At this point we come to realize that while we're definitely trying the same flavor, the cans' labels and lists of ingredients differ slightly. Apparently my deliveries of some flavors are from more recent stock. We decide any differences are probably negligible.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Back to the Cherry Vanilla:<br />Ana: I like the flavor<br />Dan: I want to put a shot glass of this on top of an ice cream sundae.<br />Me: Yeah, it does seem one step away from a hyper-concentrated syrup. Vintage Cola is too diluted and this one isn't diluted enough.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here Dan wonders what goes in actual cherry pie filling, leading the conversation into a rabbit hole involving black birds and other avian pies, down to a poisoned pigeon pie in a Game of Thrones episode.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"backgroundColor":"luminous-vivid-amber"} --></p>
<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-amber-background-color has-background"><a href="https://drinkolipop.com/products/ginger-lemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ginger Lemon</a></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is our final flavor of the ten available!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Color/Bouquet</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ana: It looks like lemonade<br />Dan: Nice smelling. I smell some ginger and some lemon<br />Ana: A little cloudy<br />Me: I smell more ginger</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Taste</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dan: I'm not a big fan of ginger<br />Ana: I really like this. It's one of my favorites. It's not very sweet at all.<br />Me: I really like strong ginger. I wish this had more bite. It's very sedate. The lemon is more just an aftertaste, like a hint of acid.<br />Ana: It tastes less like a soda because it's less sweet. It tastes more sophisticated.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Impressions</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dan: I'm not sure I could tell when this goes flat. Very little carbonation.<br />We agree it's probably the most "mature" of the flavors.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":1} --></p>
<h1>Final Rankings</h1>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After some discussion and contemplation, we came up with our personal stack ranks. Ana notes that she doesn't really have a favorite as much as a drink she's more likely to select for different needs. We all agree that none of the flavors are completely bad.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Me: There's nothing I would absolutely refuse to drink again.<br />Ana: I think the root beer is there for me.</p>
