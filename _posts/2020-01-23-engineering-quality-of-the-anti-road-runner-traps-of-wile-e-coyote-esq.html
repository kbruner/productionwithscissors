<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At one point a number of years ago, when I was working at Yahoo!, my team somehow got into an IRC discussion about why Wile E. Coyote always failed to catch the Road Runner.&nbsp; Was Coyote just a bad engineer or was ACME Co.'s quality assurance just non-existent?&nbsp; (Of course, the latter option begs the question, if ACME goods were so shoddy, how smart was Coyote to keep using them?)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At the time, I firmly came down on the side of Coyote being a crappy engineer.&nbsp; Not long after, I realized that one of the Looney Tunes DVD collections I had contained an entire disc dedicated to golden-era Coyote v. Road-Runner cartoons, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to do some research.&nbsp; I watched all those cartoons, taking notes and tallying the root cause of the failure of each of Coyote's traps.&nbsp; I posted it on Google+ and then... forgot about it.&nbsp; Until after Google shut Google+ down, taking the content with it.&nbsp; (Dammit, Google!)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you're familiar with this blog's format, that story does, in fact, serve as my standard horror story opener for this post.&nbsp; I think at this point Google's penchant for taking beloved services out back and putting a bullet in their head (I still remember you, Reader!) has reached legendary status, making it a perfect opener.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That said, I decided I should recreate the original post.&nbsp; I will be watching the same cartoons on the same disc.&nbsp; I will spare you the gory details of how I hadn't used my DVD player in at least a year, so I spent almost half an hour looking in and behind and under the sofa for its remote control.&nbsp; In the process, I managed to dislodge a lot of detritus and realized I really need to vacuum the couch, although I did make the cats happy with all the toys that came out from under the couch.&nbsp; (No, I really was sparing you the gory details there.)&nbsp; Finally, I thought to look for the remote control in the most unlikeliest of places: next to the DVD player.&nbsp; How the remote got there, I have no earthly idea, but there it was, and after swapping in some fresh batteries, I was good to go.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For reference, all these cartoons were directed by the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Jones">Chuck Jones</a>.&nbsp; Also, I'll only give full descriptions for the first few cartoons and simply show tallies for the rest, both because otherwise a 5-minute cartoon ends up taking half an hour to write up, and because I did the exact same thing last time.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, without further ado:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Beep, Beep (1952)
<ul>
<li>Traps
<ul>
<li>Trap 1: Boxing glove affixed to large, compressed spring, which was fastened to a boulder.&nbsp; Coyote hides behind the boulder, ready to release the spring and knock out the passing Road Runner
<ul>
<li>Result: When releasing the spring, the glove remained stationary while the boulder was propelled backward, smashing Coyote into a rocky overhang</li>
<li>RCA: Cartoon physics. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 2: Coyote carries an anvil across a tightwire between two cliffs lining the road, preparing to drop it on Road Runner
<ul>
<li>Result: Instead of being a taught tightwire, the wire stretched down to the ground when Coyote got to the middle with the anvil.&nbsp; The recoil then shot him up into the air.</li>
<li>RCA: Unknown.&nbsp; We don't know if the ACME product was mislabeled or defective, or if Coyote did not properly research the material's properties (aka, failure to do load testing) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 3: Coyote rigs a free glass of water to light a barrel of TNT when picked up.
<ul>
<li>Result: Apparently road runners can't read and don't drink water.&nbsp; They can write signs communicating as much, however.</li>
<li>RCA: We'll chalk this one up to unexpected user behavior. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 4: Coyote positions himself on catapult consisting of two hinged boards with a spring compressed between them, held ready by a restraining rope.
<ul>
<li>Result: When he cuts the rope with a knife, the catapult slams him into the pavement</li>
<li>RCA: Engineering failure.&nbsp; Seriously. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 5: Coyote uses belts to attach himself to a rocket mounted horizontally on four wheels, with bicycle handlebars affixed to the rocket.
<ul>
<li>Result: Upon lighting of its fuse, the rocket still manages to launch itself into the sky, taking the Coyote with it, before exploding into fireworks.</li>
<li>RCA: Another tough call.&nbsp; We'll put this one under "unknown." </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 6: Wearing ACME brand Rocket Powered Roller Skates, Coyote attempts to catch Road Runner at his own speed.
<ul>
<li>Result: It seems Coyote can't actually roller skate.&nbsp; Also, the skates don't appear to have brakes.</li>
<li>RCA: I'm calling this an engineering failure.&nbsp; I see no evidence that Coyote attempted to RTFM. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 3 revisited: Once the rocket-powered roller skates run out of fuel, after having knocked Coyote around mightily, he's left in front of the water-glass-triggered-TNT trap.&nbsp; And he takes the water glass.&nbsp; And the TNT goes off.
<ul>
<li>Revised result: Engineering success!&nbsp; I'll give Coyote credit, even though it does also have a whiff of technical debt to leave the trap out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 7: Coyote builds a fake railroad crossing with a short length of track, obscuring the ends with bushes.
<ul>
<li>Result: Road Runner races over the track, knocking Coyote onto it, leaving him dazed.&nbsp; Then a train comes.</li>
<li>RCA: Cartoon physics strikes again.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RCA Tally
<ul>
<li>Engineering failures: 2</li>
<li>ACME failures: 0</li>
<li>Unknown: 2</li>
<li>Cartoon physics: 2</li>
<li>Engineering success: 1  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Going! Going! Gosh! (1952)
<ul>
<li>Traps
<ul>
<li>Trap 1: Coyote ties a stick of dynamite to an arrow.&nbsp; As Road Runner approaches, Coyote lights the fuse and draws the arrow.
<ul>
<li>Result: Coyote releases the bow instead of the arrow.&nbsp; Dynamite explodes.</li>
<li>RCA: Engineering failure.&nbsp; Pretty sure he tested his shooting skills on production data (aka lit dynamite). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 2: Coyote sets up an over-sized slingshot in the ground, using himself (with knife and fork and bib) as the projectile.
<ul>
<li>Result: As he walks back to get maximum tension, the slingshot gets pulled from the ground and pins him to a large (pink) cactus.</li>
<li>RCA: Engineering failure. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 3: Coyote covers a section of road with a layer of quick-drying cement (not explicitly labeled as ACME, btw)
<ul>
<li>Result: When Road Runner plows through the cement at speed, he splashes it onto the Coyote.&nbsp; Who then gets stuck with the sizable grimace on his face when the cement dries.</li>
<li>RCA: We'll be fair and call this unknown.&nbsp; While the trap probably would not have succeeded, it only back-fired because of bad luck on timing. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 4: Coyote hides under a man-hole cover in the road, armed with a grenade.
<ul>
<li>Result: When he hears the Road Runner "meep meep," Coyote pulls the pin and prepares to throw.&nbsp; Except the Road Runner was on a road above his and knocked a large boulder onto the manhole cover, trapping Coyote with the live grenade.</li>
<li>RCA: We'll call this engineering.&nbsp; Verify that user input. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 5: Coyote dresses as a hitchhiking blond with high heels and a short skirt.
<ul>
<li>Result: Road Runner rushes past, knocking Coyote down, then returns with a sign explaining, "I already have a date."</li>
<li>RCA: We'll call this one blameless. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 6: Coyote places a canvas painted with a t<em>rompe l'oeil&nbsp;</em>to disguise the dead-end of a road that ends with a cliff.
<ul>
<li>Result: Road Runner continues into the painting's road.&nbsp; Coyote, dumb-founded, stands in front, scratching his head.&nbsp; Then a truck comes out of the painting road, flattening Coyote.&nbsp; Coyote, furious, decides to run into the painting to catch up with Road Runner.&nbsp; Instead, he runs through the canvas, falling off the cliff.</li>
<li>RCA: Cartoon physics X 2 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 7: Coyote rolls a large boulder onto a descending mountain pass road.
<ul>
<li>Result: Road Runner, coming up the road, evades the boulder, which then somehow manages to roll up a circular overhang which launches it into the air, where it lands above Coyote's position, surprising and then immediately flattening him.</li>
<li>RCA: Cartoon physics strikes again.&nbsp; While the plan was never going to work, that boulder had air that would make professional skateboarders envious. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 8: Using a variety of products (admittedly, only one, the "Street Cleaner's Wagon," was labeled as coming from ACME), Coyote creates a fan-propelled, (not hot-air) balloon vehicle, intending to use it to fly over Road Runner and drop an anvil on him.
<ul>
<li>Result: When the anvil is released, the vehicle shoots up into the air, at which point the string tying the balloon shut comes undone, dropping Coyote into the road.&nbsp; At which point the anvil lands on his head.</li>
<li>RCA: I can't really chalk this up to cartoon physics (Newton's third law in action!)&nbsp; Engineering failure.&nbsp; The ACME Street Cleaner's Wagon actually came out remarkably intact, incidentally. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 9: Coyote ties one end of a length of rope to log overhanging the road, suspended across two cliffs, tying the other end around his waste.&nbsp; When he hears the familiar "meep, meep," he swings off the cliff, holding a spear.
<ul>
<li>Result: He is met with a truck whose horn sounds just like a road runner.&nbsp; The force of the collision sends him spinning around the suspended log, where he somehow gets tied to the log under the length of rope.</li>
<li>RCA: We'll call this unknown.&nbsp; We do have some cartoon physics, but... Road Runner was driving the truck. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RCA Tally
<ul>
<li>Engineering failures: 4</li>
<li>ACME failures: 0</li>
<li>Unknown: 2</li>
<li>Cartoon physics: 3</li>
<li>Engineering success: 0   </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zipping Along (1953)
<ul>
<li>Traps
<ul>
<li>Trap 1: Coyote + grenade
<ul>
<li>Result: Attempting to remove the pin with his teeth, he instead throws the pin at Road Runner and is left with a live grenade in his mouth.</li>
<li>RCA: Engineer(ing) failure </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 2: Coyote places a couple dozen mouse traps on the road.
<ul>
<li>Result: Road Runner blows past the spot, sending the traps flying into Coyote's hiding spot.</li>
<li>RCA: Engineering failure.&nbsp; I have no idea how this was supposed to work. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 3: Using an ACME Giant Kite Kit and an unlabeled bomb, Coyote attempts to become airborne, hanging onto the kite with one hand and holding the bomb in the other.
<ul>
<li>Result: After getting a few short-lived airborne hops while getting a running start, Coyote reaches the cliff's edge and plummets to the ground, where the bomb explodes.</li>
<li>RCA: Engineering failure. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 4: Coyote attempts to chop down a conveniently-located roadside tree to fall on a passing Road Runner.
<ul>
<li>Result: The tree was actually a telephone pole, and when it fell, it pulled its nearest neighbor down onto Coyote.</li>
<li>RCA: Engineering failure.&nbsp; Coyote did not practice reasonable situational awareness. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 5: Coyote mixes Ace brand steel shot into a box of ACME bird seed and pours the mixture into the road.&nbsp; When Road Runner consumes the mixture, Coyote attempts to use a giant magnet to pull the bird to him.
<ul>
<li>Result: Instead of Road Runner, the magnet attracts a barrel of TNT, which promptly explodes.</li>
<li>RCA:&nbsp; ... cartoon physics? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 6: Coyote reads a book on hypnotism to learn how to make a person jump off cliff.&nbsp; Coyote practices on a fly, which promptly jumps off a rock.
<ul>
<li>Result: When Coyote attempts to use his newfound skill on Road Runner, the bird whips out a mirror, causing Coyote to hypnotize himself.</li>
<li>RCA: Engineering success! </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 7: Coyote constructs a see-saw with a board using a rock as a fulcrum.&nbsp; He then stands on one end, holding a large rock, which he throws at the other end to catapult himself into the air.
<ul>
<li>Result: Instead of landing on the other end of the board, the boulder lands on Coyote.</li>
<li>RCA: Engineering failure. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 8: Coyote mounts a number of rifles to a board positioned on a cliff over the road, tying strings to each trigger.
<ul>
<li>Result: When Coyote pulls the strings, the guns all shoot him.</li>
<li>RCA: Engineering failure.&nbsp; He <em>was</em> standing right next to Road Runner when he pulled the strings. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 9: Coyote prepares to cut the end of a rope bridge when Road Runner crosses it.
<ul>
<li>Result: Instead of the rope bridge, the cliff Coyote is standing on plummets to the... well, plummets somewhere</li>
<li>RCA: Cartoon physics. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 10: Coyote loads himself in a Human Cannonball cannon after lighting the fuse.
<ul>
<li>Result: The cannon is propelled backward, while Coyote hangs, singed, in midair.&nbsp; At least he was wearing a helmet.</li>
<li>RCA: Cartoon physics. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 11: Coyote stands one board suspended between two cliffs, holding a giant wrecking ball that is tied by rope to another board some distance down the road.&nbsp; When Road Runner approaches, Coyote releases the ball.
<ul>
<li>Result: Road Runner stops short of the ball's reach.&nbsp; The ball then loops over its anchoring board, arcs through the air without losing any tension in the rope, and smacks Coyote from above.</li>
<li>RCA: While we do have some cartoon physics at play, the ball was going to swing back close enough to its starting point either way.&nbsp; Engineering failure. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trap 12: Coyote constructs a fake storefront across a narrow mountain pass, offering free birdseed "inside."&nbsp; Behind it, he has set up a large amount of TNT, all connected to an ACME detonator, placed so the plunger should theoretically trigger when the door is opened.&nbsp; Coyote then climbs over the facade and hides nearby.
<ul>
<li>Result: A truck comes barreling down the narrow pass, chasing Coyote back to the facade... where he opens the door.</li>
<li>RCA: Engineering success!  </li>

<p>In sum, I'd say that not only is Coyote, well, a lousy engineer, but that ACME products, at least during this era, often worked a little <em>too</em> well.</p>

<p>A few notes that may or may not be worth reading:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Everything</em> can be cast as a DevOps parable.</li>
<li>I worked for a time for Warner Bros Animation.&nbsp; I may or may not have a film credit on <em>Osmosis Jones</em>.&nbsp; (I can't bring myself to watch it again to find out.  I only saw a rough cut while it was still in production.)&nbsp; I definitely had to fix Brad Bird's email once while he was directing <em>The Iron Giant</em>, though.&nbsp; Netscape Navigator, RIP.</li>
<li>My father started as a mechanical engineer and was, probably not coincidentally, also a Road Runner/Wile E Coyote fan.&nbsp; I had bought this Looney Tunes collection to watch with him while he was ill, but... I never got the chance to watch it with him.&nbsp; It sat on my shelf, still shrink-wrapped, for a couple years, until I finally had a reason to watch these cartoons.</li>
<li>The spirit (and (lack of) engineering discipline and basic common sense) lives on in, well, most of the Silicon Valley start-ups I've worked for, to some degree or another.</li>
<li>Seriously, leave a cat toy under the couch for a few months, and when you finally fish it out, it's brand-new to the cats who knocked it there in the first place.</li>
<li>I still have no idea how the DVD player remote ended up next to the DVD player.</li>
