## [TWO YEARS (cont)](https://productionwithscissors.run/2020/11/15/1001-3-insomniac-nights/#two-years)

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

... sat down, combed through the `log4j` docs and examples, altered the logger class and made a test app that showed that, by using a different `log4j` method (or maybe it was a method option? I can't remember), the multi-line stack traces would appear in Sumo as single, discrete log entries.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I don't generally have the inclination to say, "I told you so," (especially when it should really go without saying), but TWO YEARS. I told my boss I wanted t-shirts distributed to everyone in engineering saying, "Karen was right."

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The t-shirts were not forthcoming. I left the company soon thereafter.

## The Hottest Office

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

At Yahoo!, I worked on the operations side for the server imaging system. We got a call one day that the server closet in one office had overheated and they needed help imaging the replacement office servers. This took a little sleight of hand because the imaging service wasn't set up to handle office locations, which were not part of the production network.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This story is only noteworthy because the office in question which had overheated was in Norway.

## Freeway Crosswalk

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I worked at a record company in downtown Burbank which had a beautiful, fancy new office building on the north side of the 134 freeway. However, my team sat in the not-so-beautiful, definitely-not-fancy, not-at-all-new office building directly opposite on the other side of the freeway.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The data center room was in the shiny new building, of course, so after we prepped or fixed servers in our office, we had to stick them in a cart and then walk them across the freeway to take them to the data center.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All right, there was an overpass between the two, fortunately, but that doesn't sound as impressive and ruins the mental imagery.

## With a Wave of My Hand...

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

At a small startup, we were in a planning meeting for a major service application upgrade. Someone asks to confirm if the staging instances in EC2 are up. Someone checks using the AWS web GUI. "Yes, we have a staging instance." A minute later: "Oops, I think I accidentally deleted the staging instance in the GUI."

## Printers: The Great Unsolved Problem

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

So many printer stories. Here are a few, in no particular order.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There was the Iris printer at one animation studio. (Digital animation studios used a shit-ton of paper, go figure.) I'm not sure if it was warranted or just a scam, but they had a full-time person whose only responsibility was keeping that thing running. I was afraid to go near it, lest I sneezed.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The same studio had another large-format printer, although it did not have its own full-time nanny. (I want to say it was an HP, maybe?) Usually the same two technicians changed the paper roll on that thing. It took them 30 minutes. I ended up having to change the paper alone the first time...
