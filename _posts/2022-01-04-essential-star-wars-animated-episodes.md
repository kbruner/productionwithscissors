excerpt: It's all about Ahsoka
---

Way back in 2020, immediately prior to the release of _The Mandalorian_ season 2, I put together a list of essential episodes from the animated series _The Clone Wars_ and _Rebels_, focusing mainly on Ahsoka Tano and on the history of Mandalore and the Darksaber. I shoved that into a Google Doc that I shared around to prep people who had never watched the animated series _The Clone Wars_ and _Rebels_ with a quickstart guide for characters making their live-action debut in _The Mandalorian_.

With the release of _The Book of Boba Fett_ and the Disney+ slate of upcoming series, apparently one each for just about every character in the Star Wars universe, I've updated the list with a few more characters.

### A few notes

* This list contains episodes which I personally think are important or interesting. Other people who have also sat through a bajillion hours of these shows and movies are entitled to make their own lists.
* For table entries with multiple episodes, the episodes comprise a story arc.
* I use the season.episode number convention. (_Example_: episode 3 of season 1 would be 1.3. An arc of episodes 12-14 from season 2 would be 2.12-14)
* Main characters/entities for an arc are **in bold**.
* Currently supported characters/entities
  * Ahsoka Tano
  * Mandalore
    * Bo-Katan Kryze
    * Darksaber
  * Boba Fett
  * Asajj Ventress (_Clone Wars_ series villain)
  * Maul (oops, spoiler)
* Disney+ lists _The Clone Wars_ in their original release order, which does not correspond at all with the actual story chronology until the final seasons. The list below conforms to [the proper order](https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-clone-wars-chronological-episodeorder).
* _Bad Batch_ season 1 features many supporting characters we've seen in other series. I haven't added any of them here, although that may change.
* _Rebels_ has a more linear, self-contained storyline. You can watch the whole thing or not. Warning: Ezra Bridger is just so ducking annoying.
