I've renamed this site from "Nightmare Before Devops" to "Running In Production With Scissors." I chose the original name years ago from a joke that came out of a conversation at DevopsDay, but it doesn't feel like what my posts are actually usually about at this point.


Also, the nightmares continue.


And the new .run TLD makes the domain name its own little programming joke.
