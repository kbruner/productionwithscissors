<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So many printer stories. Here are a few, in no particular order.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There was the Iris printer at one animation studio. (Digital animation studios used a shit-ton of paper, go figure.) I'm not sure if it was warranted or just a scam, but they had a full-time person whose only responsibility was keeping that thing running. I was afraid to go near it, lest I sneezed.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The same studio had another large-format printer, although it did not have its own full-time nanny. (I want to say it was an HP, maybe?) Usually the same two technicians changed the paper roll on that thing. It took them 30 minutes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I ended up having to do it alone my first time. It took me 45 minutes to figure it out. (There were no written instructions, just some of those "international" drawn mime diagrams under the hood, which only succeeded at being internationally inscrutable.)</p>
